# Idea
- Objects (Only one in the scene at once)
	- Self made
		- Cube
		- Cuboid
		- Chair
	- From blender
		- Utah's pot
		- Small basic aliens
	- Get text to vertices mapper (Extra)
		- Then we can take a word as input and create a 2D Thingy
- Transformations (GUI based controls)
	- Translate
	- Rotate
	- Scale
- Shader Class
	- Red Color
	- Green Color
	- Blue Color
	- Disco color
	- Trippy color
- Camera Class : https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera
	- World moves around the camera mechanism
	- WASD = movement (Pan)
	- Scroll = Zoom
	- J,K,L = Pitch, Yaw, Roll controls

# Code
- [ ] Rewrite the `Shader` class to read from files
- [x] Change the `main.cpp` file
- [x] Understand the views
- [ ] Change `Camera` class - Yaw and Pitch to {I,J,K,L} controls
	- [ ] Add Shift + {A,D,Q,Z} for pan pinned to Center
